DAuid
The DAuid uniquely identifies a dissemination area. It is composed of the two-digit province/territory code, the two-digit census division code and the four-digit dissemination area code.

Many of these postal codesOM tend to straddle several dissemination areas and often cross boundaries of standard geographic areas such as census tracts or census subdivisions. (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-154-g/92-154-g2017001-eng.htm)
